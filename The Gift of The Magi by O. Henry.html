<h1>The Gift of the Magi</h1>

<h2 class="no-break">by O. Henry</h2>

<div class="chapter">

    <p>
        One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it was in
        pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the
        vegetable man and the butcher until one&rsquo;s cheeks burned with the silent
        imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della
        counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be
        Christmas.
    </p>

    <p>
        There was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and
        howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection that life is made
        up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles predominating.
    </p>

    <p>
        While the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to
        the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8 per week. It did
        not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on the lookout
        for the mendicancy squad.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter would go, and an
        electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring. Also
        appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name &ldquo;Mr. James Dillingham
        Young.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
        The &ldquo;Dillingham&rdquo; had been flung to the breeze during a former
        period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per week. Now, when
        the income was shrunk to $20, though, they were thinking seriously of
        contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham
        Young came home and reached his flat above he was called &ldquo;Jim&rdquo; and
        greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as
        Della. Which is all very good.
    </p>

    <p>
        Della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag. She
        stood by the window and looked out dully at a gray cat walking a gray fence in
        a gray backyard. Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with
        which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving every penny she could for
        months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn&rsquo;t go far. Expenses
        had been greater than she had calculated. They always are. Only $1.87 to buy a
        present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent planning for
        something nice for him. Something fine and rare and sterling&mdash;something
        just a little bit near to being worthy of the honor of being owned by Jim.
    </p>

    <p>
        There was a pier glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have seen a
        pier glass in an $8 flat. A very thin and very agile person may, by observing
        his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly
        accurate conception of his looks. Della, being slender, had mastered the art.
    </p>

    <p>
        Suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. Her eyes were
        shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its color within twenty seconds.
        Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which they
        both took a mighty pride. One was Jim&rsquo;s gold watch that had been his
        father&rsquo;s and his grandfather&rsquo;s. The other was Della&rsquo;s hair.
        Had the queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have
        let her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her
        Majesty&rsquo;s jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all
        his treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch
        every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy.
    </p>

    <p>
        So now Della&rsquo;s beautiful hair fell about her rippling and shining like a
        cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself almost a
        garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she
        faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn
        red carpet.
    </p>

    <p>
        On went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts
        and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she fluttered out the door
        and down the stairs to the street.
    </p>

    <p>
        Where she stopped the sign read: &ldquo;Mme. Sofronie. Hair Goods of All
        Kinds.&rdquo; One flight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting. Madame,
        large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the &ldquo;Sofronie.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
        &ldquo;Will you buy my hair?&rdquo; asked Della.
    </p>

    <p>
        &ldquo;I buy hair,&rdquo; said Madame. &ldquo;Take yer hat off and let&rsquo;s
        have a sight at the looks of it.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
        Down rippled the brown cascade.
    </p>

    <p>
        &ldquo;Twenty dollars,&rdquo; said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised
        hand.
    </p>

    <p>
        &ldquo;Give it to me quick,&rdquo; said Della.
    </p>

    <p>
        Oh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed
        metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim&rsquo;s present.
    </p>

    <p>
        She found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. There
        was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them
        inside out. It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly
        proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious
        ornamentation&mdash;as all good things should do. It was even worthy of The
        Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be Jim&rsquo;s. It was like
        him. Quietness and value&mdash;the description applied to both. Twenty-one
        dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried home with the 87 cents. With
        that chain on his watch Jim might be properly anxious about the time in any
        company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes looked at it on the sly on
        account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain.
    </p>

    <p>
        When Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and
        reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work
        repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which is always a
        tremendous task, dear friends&mdash;a mammoth task.
    </p>

    <p>
        Within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that
        made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at her reflection
        in the mirror long, carefully, and critically.
    </p>

    <p>
        &ldquo;If Jim doesn&rsquo;t kill me,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;before
        he takes a second look at me, he&rsquo;ll say I look like a Coney Island chorus
        girl. But what could I do&mdash;oh! what could I do with a dollar and
        eighty-seven cents?&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
        At 7 o&rsquo;clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on the back of
        the stove hot and ready to cook the chops.
    </p>

    <p>
        Jim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the
        corner of the table near the door that he always entered. Then she heard his
        step on the stair away down on the first flight, and she turned white for just
        a moment. She had a habit of saying a little silent prayer about the simplest
        everyday things, and now she whispered: &ldquo;Please God, make him think I am
        still pretty.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
        The door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and very
        serious. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two&mdash;and to be burdened with a
        family! He needed a new overcoat and he was without gloves.
    </p>

    <p>
        Jim stopped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail.
        His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was an expression in them that she
        could not read, and it terrified her. It was not anger, nor surprise, nor
        disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared
        for. He simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face.
    </p>

    <p>
        Della wriggled off the table and went for him.
    </p>

    <p>
        &ldquo;Jim, darling,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t look at me that way.
        I had my hair cut off and sold because I couldn&rsquo;t have lived through
        Christmas without giving you a present. It&rsquo;ll grow out again&mdash;you
        won&rsquo;t mind, will you? I just had to do it. My hair grows awfully fast.
        Say &lsquo;Merry Christmas!&rsquo; Jim, and let&rsquo;s be happy. You
        don&rsquo;t know what a nice&mdash;what a beautiful, nice gift I&rsquo;ve got
        for you.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve cut off your hair?&rdquo; asked Jim, laboriously, as if he
        had not arrived at that patent fact yet even after the hardest mental labor.
    </p>

    <p>
        &ldquo;Cut it off and sold it,&rdquo; said Della. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like
        me just as well, anyhow? I&rsquo;m me without my hair, ain&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
        Jim looked about the room curiously.
    </p>

    <p>
        &ldquo;You say your hair is gone?&rdquo; he said, with an air almost of idiocy.
    </p>

    <p>
        &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t look for it,&rdquo; said Della. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
        sold, I tell you&mdash;sold and gone, too. It&rsquo;s Christmas Eve, boy. Be
        good to me, for it went for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were
        numbered,&rdquo; she went on with sudden serious sweetness, &ldquo;but nobody
        could ever count my love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
        Out of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his Della. For ten
        seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the
        other direction. Eight dollars a week or a million a year&mdash;what is the
        difference? A mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer. The magi
        brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them. This dark assertion will
        be illuminated later on.
    </p>

    <p>
        Jim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table.
    </p>

    <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make any mistake, Dell,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;about me. I
        don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or
        a shampoo that could make me like my girl any less. But if you&rsquo;ll unwrap
        that package you may see why you had me going a while at first.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
        White fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And then an ecstatic
        scream of joy; and then, alas! a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and
        wails, necessitating the immediate employment of all the comforting powers of
        the lord of the flat.
    </p>

    <p>
        For there lay The Combs&mdash;the set of combs, side and back, that Della had
        worshipped long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise shell,
        with jewelled rims&mdash;just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair.
        They were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and
        yearned over them without the least hope of possession. And now, they were
        hers, but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were
        gone.
    </p>

    <p>
        But she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up with
        dim eyes and a smile and say: &ldquo;My hair grows so fast, Jim!&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
        And then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, &ldquo;Oh,
        oh!&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
        Jim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to him eagerly upon
        her open palm. The dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her
        bright and ardent spirit.
    </p>

    <p>
        &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it.
        You&rsquo;ll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your
        watch. I want to see how it looks on it.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
        Instead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the
        back of his head and smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
        &ldquo;Dell,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s put our Christmas presents away
        and keep &rsquo;em a while. They&rsquo;re too nice to use just at present. I
        sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs. And now suppose you put the
        chops on.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
        The magi, as you know, were wise men&mdash;wonderfully wise men&mdash;who
        brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving
        Christmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly
        bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And here I have
        lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a
        flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of
        their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that
        of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. Of all who give and receive
        gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest. They are the magi.
